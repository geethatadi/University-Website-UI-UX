**Project Overview**
This project focuses on improving the UI/UX design of a university website to make it more accessible and user-friendly for visually impaired students. The goal is to address key challenges related to accessibility, diversity information, and admissions guidance for prospective students, such as Amy, a visually impaired prospective student. The design was created to ensure that Amy and similar users can easily access and navigate critical information.
The project uses interactive design elements created in PowerPoint to simulate the user interface and experience.

**Features:**
Enhanced Accessibility Features: Improved design for better readability, voice navigation, and alternative text descriptions for images.
Diversity Information Accessibility: A dedicated section for diversity statistics and inclusive programs.
Specialized Admissions Guidance: A system to guide visually impaired students through the admissions process, offering tailored support.

**Interactive Prototypes in PowerPoint:**
The interactive design was created using PowerPoint, allowing users to explore the various features and functionalities as if interacting with a live website. This prototype simulates the user flow and layout design, focusing on user navigation, accessibility features, and the ease of accessing critical information.

**Objectives:**
Improve accessibility for visually impaired students.
Make diversity information easily accessible.
Provide specialized guidance to help visually impaired students through the university’s admissions process.
Instructions for Interacting with the Prototype
The prototype was designed with interactive features to simulate the website's navigation and accessibility functionalities. Follow these steps to interact with the PowerPoint prototype:

**Step 1: Initiating Campus Tour**
Action: Click on the "Visit Our Campus" button prominently displayed on the homepage.
Expected Outcome: You will be directed to the campus tour section, which offers a visual exploration of the university's facilities.

**Step 2: Audio Description Feature**
Action: While watching the campus tour video, observe the audio description feature.
Expected Outcome: This feature provides an auditory description of the visual content to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.

**Step 3: Accessing Contact Information**
Action: Look for and click on the "Click for More" option on the homepage.
Expected Outcome: This action will grant access to essential contact information, fostering communication with relevant university departments and support services.

**Step 4: Exploring Accessibility Options**
Action: Navigate to the "Accessibility Options" section by clicking the corresponding option.
Expected Outcome: This section provides information and assistance related to accessibility features, ensuring that visually impaired students can utilize the website effectively.

**Step 5: Information - Diversity Section**
Action: Click on the "Diversity" option to explore diversity-related statistics.
Expected Outcome: This page presents clear and accessible representation of diversity metrics, ensuring transparency and inclusivity.

**Key Design Elements and Solutions**
1. Enhanced Accessibility Features
Alternative Text Descriptions: All images and visual elements are equipped with concise and descriptive alternative text, enabling screen readers to convey this information to visually impaired users.
Contrast and Design Optimization: The design includes high contrast and larger font sizes to improve readability for visually impaired users, with clear visual hierarchies to aid navigation.

**2. Diversity Information Accessibility**
Clear Statistical Information: Diversity statistics are presented in a structured format that is compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
Interactive Visuals: Infographics and interactive visuals are designed to ensure that all users, including those with visual impairments, can easily understand the data.

**3. Specialized Admissions Guidance**
Personalized Support: The design includes features for specialized guidance from the admissions office, offering direct assistance tailored to visually impaired students.
Text-to-Speech & Screen Reader Compatibility: Support channels, such as chat and helplines, are compatible with screen readers, and text-to-speech functionality is enabled for ease of communication.

**Usability Testing Insights**
1. Testing Participants:
Prospective Student in Health Informatics: Provides insights into how the website serves the needs of students in a specific academic program.
Prospective Student with Visual Impairment: Assesses the website’s accessibility features and overall inclusivity.
Prospective Student-Athlete: Tests the website’s effectiveness for students interested in sports and athletics.

**2. Task Assignments:**
Participants were asked to complete specific tasks such as exploring program information, finding admissions details, and accessing accessibility features.
Follow-up questions helped identify pain points in the website navigation and areas needing improvement.
Design Iterations Based on Usability Feedback
The interactive design evolved based on usability testing feedback to improve the user experience, focusing on:
Improved Signposting: A clearer "Home" button was added for easier navigation.
Optimized Pathways: The "Apply Now" button and other critical paths were streamlined for quicker access to important information.
Accessibility Enhancements: Alternative text descriptions and larger fonts were incorporated to improve accessibility.

**Screenshots & Visual Annotations**
Below are some key screenshots of the interactive design along with annotations that explain how the accessibility features have been implemented:
Alternative Text for Images: Ensuring all visual elements are described for users who rely on screen readers.
Contrast and Design Optimization: Enhanced color contrast to improve visibility.
Direct Contact Information: Simplified pathways for students seeking diversity information.

**Conclusion**
This project aims to enhance the university website's accessibility and usability for visually impaired students while also improving the availability of diversity and admissions information. The interactive PowerPoint prototype effectively simulates the website’s interface and highlights key design changes based on usability feedback.
